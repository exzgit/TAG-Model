# TAG Model (Text Assistant Generative Model)
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my project on Artificial Intelligence Text Generative, created by Ezra Valen Ne Tofa.

### Overview
TAG Model (Text Assistant Generative Model) is a project that aims to build a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) technology with Transformer architecture. The chatbot is designed to be able to understand and respond to text with better context, so as to provide users with a more natural interaction experience.

# 



### Model Architecture
The TAG Model uses the Transformer architecture, which consists of multiple Transformer encoder layers. Each Transformer encoder layer consists of two main components: a multi-head self-attention layer and a feed-forward neural network layer. The attention process allows the model to focus on important parts of the input while building a better representation.

### Features
- Able to understand and respond to text with better context.
- Can provide relevant answers based on user input.
- Equipped with advanced Transformer architecture to enhance learning quality.

### Pros:
- Able to notice context in conversations to provide more relevant responses.
- Uses advanced Transformer architecture to learn a better representation of the text.
- Equipped with the ability to handle different language variations and conversation styles.

### Disadvantages:
- Requires a large amount of data to train the model well.
- Requires considerable training time especially when using large datasets.
- May produce imprecise responses if not sufficiently trained with representative data.
